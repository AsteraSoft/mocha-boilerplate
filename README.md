# Mocha boilerplate
Boilerplate for small JS projects or experiments.

# Why?
Because I needed a quick boilerplate for some JavaScript experiments,
with which I could easily add a new file, some tests and have them run
in the browser, and in the console thought `mocha-phantomjs`.

# Usage
Download the boilerplate and then use one of these methods:

## Using the browser
Open the file `test/runner.html`

## From the terminal
Use `mocha-phantomjs` to run the runner.html. For this task you
should have `mocha-phantomjs` installed. You could install it with
`npm install mocha-phantomjs`.

Finally, run your tests with `npm test`.
